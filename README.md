# PyVirus
This is a Google Chrome Extension that while I can't publish, is a test virus for a funny CS project.
This code simply creates a new tab when not on the target website, and hides the HTML elements, creates an alert, and logs to the console when it is on the correct website.
It's pretty simple, but the code will rest here incase I need it for the future.
